1 The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
2 It's a very mean and nasty place and.

4 I don't care how tough you are it will beat.
5 You to your knees and keep you there permanently.
6 If you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit.
7 As hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you.
8 Hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep.
9 Moving forward. How much you can take and keep.
10 Moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now.
11 If you know what you're worth then go out and get.
12 What you're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take.
13 The hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't.
14 Where you wanna be because of him, or her, or.
15 Anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you!.

16 You're better than that! I'm always gonna love you.
17 No matter what. No matter what happens. You're my.
18 Son and you're my blood. You're the best thing in.
19 My life. But until you start believing in yourself.
20 Ya ain't gonna have a life. Don't forget to.
21 Visit your mother.
